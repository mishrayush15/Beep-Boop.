# Beep Boop

This project is a simple React application for ARCADE HACKCLUB SUMMER CHALLENGE that changes the cursor every 5 seconds. The application is styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

The Cursor Color Changer website dynamically updates the cursor color to enhance the visual experience. Every 5 seconds, the cursor changes to a different MEME, cycling through a set of predefined styles.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Cursor Style**: The website starts with an initial cursor MEME.
2. **Meme Change Interval**: Every 2 seconds, the cursor style changes to the next MEME in the list. 
3. **Implementation**: This is achieved using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the state and interval logic.
